The Fortune Teller

Why pay a fortune teller when you can just program your fortune yourself?

- Store the following into variables:
  number of children, partner's name, geographic location, job title.

- Output your fortune to the screen like so:
  "You will be a X in Y, and married to Z with N kids."

var geoLocal = "Miami";

var jobTitle = "Hacker";

console.log("You will be a "+ jobTitle+ " in " + geoLocal + ", and married\
 to " + partnerName + " with " + numChildren+ " kids.");
