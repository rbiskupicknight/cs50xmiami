/*
The Fortune Teller

Why pay a fortune teller when you can just program your fortune yourself?

- Store the following into variables:
  number of children, partner's name, geographic location, job title.

- Output your fortune to the screen like so:
  "You will be a X in Y, and married to Z with N kids."

var location = "Portland";

var job = "philanthropist";

console.log("You will be a "+ job + " in " + location + ", and married to " + partner_name + " with " + children + " kids.");
